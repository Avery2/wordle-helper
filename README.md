**Warning: Docs are out of date. Everything below is correct but there are undocumented features.**

### `helper.py`

usage: `helper.py known_positions included_characters excluded_characters`

- `known_positions`: Characters with known positions as a string of length 5 with `-` as placeholders such as `--xy-`.
- `included_characters`: Characters that are included in the word but in unkown location in the form `xyz`. Use `-` if there are none.
- `excluded_characters`: Characters that are excluded in the word in the form `xyz`. Use `-` if there are none.
